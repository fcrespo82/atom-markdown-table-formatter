# Markdown Table Formatter

A simple markdown plugin to format tables.

Based on the awesome [Improved Markdown table commands for TextMate](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/03/improved-markdown-table-commands-for-textmate/) work from [Dr. Drang (@drdrang)](https://twitter.com/drdrang)

[Changelog](https://github.com/fcrespo82/atom-markdown-table-formatter/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)


## Usage

There are two basic ways of using this plugin.

1. Select the table you want to format and then hit `alt-shift-T` to format it.
2. If you didn't select any table the entire document (default) will be scanned, by the plugin, for tables and format all of them.

## instal

## Tips

### Using with `language-markdown` package

Since `language-markdown` is a community package, auto-formatting entire document is not supported out-of-the box, but that is easy to fix, see next tip.

### Enable Markdown Table Formatter for the current file type

To enable Markdown Table Formatter for your current file type: put your cursor in the file, open the Command Palette <kbd>⌘ (CMD)</kbd>+<kbd>⇧ (SHIFT)</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>, and run the `Markdown Table Formatter: Enable For Current Scope` command. This will add grammar scope from current editor to the list of scopes in the settings for the Markdown Table Formatter package. You can edit this setting manually later if you want to.

Formatting selection should work regardless though.

### How to style the tables correctly if you use non-monospace fonts

Pre Atom-1.13:

```less
atom-text-editor::shadow .table.gfm {
    font-family: monospace;
}
```

Post Atom-1.13:

```less
atom-text-editor .syntax--table.syntax--gfm {
    font-family: monospace;
}
```
